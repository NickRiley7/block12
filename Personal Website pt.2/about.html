    About
  </p>

  <text>I have a lot of things i like doing. Hunting, fishing, playing drums, and riding motorcycles are a few of them.
   I used to do tree work but I recently crashed my bike and broke my back, so while I've been hurt I started coding and
   I really like it. I hope to make a career out of it.
